# Churn_Prediction.ipynb
Telecom churn prediction using Python and machine learning (pandas, scikit-learn)
This project analyzes customer data from a telecom company to predict churn using Python. It utilizes libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning models. The repository covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visual insights to help reduce customer churn.
